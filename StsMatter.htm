        <p>All matter on Earth exists in one of three forms: solid, 
liquid, or gas. Some matter is solid—it is hard, tough, 
and keeps its shape. Some is liquid—it flows or runs, but 
it cannot be squeezed smaller or stretched bigger. Some 
is gas—it flows, and it can expand or be squeezed. 
These three forms are known as the states of matter.</p>
<p>● SOLID In a solid, such as 
ice, particles of matter are close 
together and fixed in place.</p>
<p>● LIQUID In water and 
other liquids, particles of 
matter are very close 
and can move around, 
but cannot change 
distance from each other.</p>
<p>● GAS The particles of matter in a 
gas, such as water vapor, are far 
apart, move fast, and change their 
distance from each other.</p>
